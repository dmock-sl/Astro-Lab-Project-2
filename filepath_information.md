Sorry I am almost out of space on my Linux partition and I don't want to deal with repartitioning right now so I kept all of my data on an sd card. Therefore the filepaths in the code will be wrong for you. I've separately uploaded all the relevant folders so just unzip them so it should be a simple task to correct the code for your usage. Just take out everything in the path up to and including /project2_data/ and it should work. The data can be found at this link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NMcSP8bMp2wHjOR0zPLFwERhxx_JH2k9?usp=sharing
