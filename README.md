# Project-2-Transiting-Planetary-Systems
This data and this notebook was created in completion of the third project in an Upper Division / Graduate Level Astronomy lab course at UT Austin. The purpose of this lab was to observe the transit of an exoplanet of our choosing in front of its host star. The exoplanet we choose to observe was Wasp-183 b.
